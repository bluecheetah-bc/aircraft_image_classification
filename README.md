<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<b>In this project, we dealt with classification problems for five classes. We gathered some aircraft images and then splitted them into certain directories as train and test data. 
For the purpose of model training, VGG model was used. Finally, we evaluated aircraft image classification using some different images</b>

The steps of the project are as follows:

- 1)Preparation of Aircraft Image Dataset:

  +A dataset containing aircraft images was gathered.
  
  +Clean and format the dataset. Fix or remove any missing or erroneous data.
  
  +Visualize the dataset and perform statistical analysis. Check for class distribution and take appropriate measures if there is any imbalance.

- 2)Model Selection and Training (VGG):

  +Choose the VGG model. VGG is a deep convolutional neural network architecture commonly used for image classification problems.
  
  +Train the selected VGG model. Use the training dataset for this purpose.

- 3)Making Predictions:

  +Use the trained VGG model to make predictions on the test dataset containing aircraft images.
  
  +Evaluate the predicted classes.
